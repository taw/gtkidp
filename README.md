Gtk+/CLI interface for Internet Dictionary Project

Description
===========

This project provides software to use with IDP dictionaries under
Linux and other Unices. This project doesn't redistribute dictionaries, but
they are 95% free, so you can download them from http://www.june29.com/IDP/

Note
====

This project is probably of mainly historical value only.
I'm moving my various old Open Source projects to github on an off chance someone finds them useful,
but it hasn't been maintained in very long time.
