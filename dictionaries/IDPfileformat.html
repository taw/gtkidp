<H3>File Format</h3>

  The dictionary files are lists of pairs of English and other-language
  words, in the form:
<pre>
   English-word	Other-language-word
   English-word	Other-language-word
   ...</pre>
  where the pairs are separated by a tab character, and each pair is
  terminated by a carriage return character.  The "Other-language-word" is
  a translation of the English word (see the <a href="IDPdisclaimer.html">Disclaimer</a>).
  If an English word has more than one translation into the other language,
  the English word is listed multiple times, each with a different
  "Other-language-word".  For example, in Spanish:
<pre>     dog	perro
     dog	perra</pre>
  Any comment lines in the file will begin with a pound sign ("#").  The
  files are not sorted into any particular order.

<h3>Accent Marks</h3>

  Because these files are given in plain ASCII format, accented characters
  usually are not given directly.  Certain conventions have been given to
  people adding to the IDP files for accented characters, and most of the 
  time these conventions were followed.

<dl>
<dt> <b> Spanish/Italian Accents</b>
 <dd>    A letter followed by a forward slash ("/") indicates that the letter should have an acute accent over it.
<dd>     A letter followed by a backward slash ("\") indicates that the letter
        should have a grave accent over it.
<dd>     A letter followed by a tilde ("~") indicates that the letter should
        have a tilde above it.
</dl>

<dl><dt><b>   German Accents</b>
<dd>     A letter followed by a period (".") indicates that the letter should 
        have an umlaut over it.  (This is sometimes approximated by a vowel
        followed by an "e" instead.)
<dd>     A letter followed by a caret ("^") indicates that the letter should
        have a circonflex over it.
<dd>     Two s characters in a row usually indicates the German double-s 
        character ("B")
